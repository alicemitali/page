          <h1><strong>Introduction:</strong></h1>
        <p>Hi I’m Alice! I love people and people love to feel beautiful, which is the reason I want to spend my whole life doing makeup. I believe if you feel comfortable in your skin, then you can spend your energy loving others and enjoying life instead of worrying and being self-conscious. Is makeup the best way to gain self confidence? No way! But it can help a little, plus it’s FUN! So I hope I can help your life be a little bit happier, and perhaps more colorful.</p>
